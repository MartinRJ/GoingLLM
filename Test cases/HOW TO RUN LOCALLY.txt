First set up the python environment:
Use the built-in venv module in Python to create a virtual environment. Here's how:

Open a command prompt and navigate to your project directory:
cd path\to\your\project\directory

Create a virtual environment using the built-in venv module:
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows Command Prompt:
venv\Scripts\activate

On Windows PowerShell:
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt




Then cd into the directory, and run:
set FLASK_APP=LOCAL
if the script is called LOCAL.py
